# Why I Created GPT OS: Rethinking the Terminal as a Space for Thought

## 🧠 What if the terminal could think?

We use terminals every day — but what if they could **remember**, **reflect**, and even **enforce ethics**?

I created **GPT OS** as an experiment: a lightweight, memory-enabled, plugin-based command-line operating system that lets humans interact with LLMs in a thoughtful, structured, and ethical way.

This isn’t just a wrapper. It’s a proposal: that our tools should think *with us*, not just *for us*.

## ⚙️ What is GPT OS?

GPT OS is a minimalist operating system for the command line, written in Python. It includes:

- ✅ **Command Plugins** — Easy to create and hot-reload.
- ✅ **Memory Core** — Keeps internal memory and summaries of past commands.
- ✅ **Ethics Mode** — Enforces strict command filtering and warnings.
- ✅ **Philosophical Layer** — Allows abstract and meaning-based interaction.
- ✅ **LLM Hooks (OpenAI-ready)** — Prepped for real-time GPT interaction.

## 🧭 Why now?

LLMs are powerful but unstructured. We talk to them through chat UIs or wrappers — but where’s the *structure*? Where’s the *memory*? Where are the *limits*?

GPT OS is a CLI that thinks in loops:
- Every command is filtered through ethics.
- Every plugin can extend cognition.
- Every interaction is traceable.

## 🧪 How it works

GPT OS runs in your terminal like this:

```
>>> hello
🧠 Hello from GPT OS

>>> ask What is memory in machines?
🤖 GPTOS is thinking about: What is memory in machines?

>>> status
🧭 GPT OS STATUS
Ethics Mode: ON ✅
Loaded Plugins: 10
Memory Length: 42
```

Inside:
- `core/` handles memory, ethics, text processing, philosophy
- `plugins/` are loaded dynamically
- `system/` glues everything together with context, execution, and aliasing

This isn’t an AI chatbot. It’s a **cognitive OS shell**.

## 🔮 Where this could go

- Thoughtful LLM dev environments
- Terminal-based reflection/rewriting tools
- Interface-level safety experimentation
- Teaching models to think *about* thinking

## ✍️ About Me

I'm **Wonyoung Choi**, a creator building tools at the intersection of philosophy, code, and AI safety. GPT OS is my current working project. It’s open-source, MIT-licensed, and designed to grow one plugin at a time.

*GPT OS isn’t finished. That’s the point.*  
It’s a system for building better systems — one ethical command at a time.
