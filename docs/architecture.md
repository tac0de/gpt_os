# GPT OS Architecture

## Purpose

This document outlines the **internal architecture and design philosophy** of GPT OS ‚Äî a modular operating system simulation for Large Language Models (LLMs).
It is not intended for general users, but for engineers, reviewers, and architects evaluating the inner mechanics of a GPT-structured memory and logic protocol stack.

---

## üß† Core Module Definitions

GPT OS is structured around six independent, logic-specific cores. Each core functions like a subsystem in a traditional OS.

| Core            | Role Description |
|------------------|------------------|
| `CommandCore`    | Central dispatcher for commands; interprets parsed input |
| `TextCore`       | Parses raw user input into structured components |
| `MemoryCore`     | Simulates memory storage and retrieval (key-value RAM) |
| `ImageCore`      | Recommends visual prompts and connects to generation modules |
| `PhilosophyCore` | Handles reflection, paradoxes, meta-inference |
| `CodeCore`       | Evaluates or executes Python expressions |

Each core is instanced and registered once at runtime and locked into the OS lifecycle via the `StateManager`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Engine Components

| Component          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `index.py`         | Entry point that initializes all system modules and loops |
| `state_manager.py` | Tracks and enforces `~apply` locking of modules |
| `workflow_logger.py` | Logs all command executions and system actions |
| `debug_tools.py`   | Provides runtime diagnostics of GPT OS core state |

---

## üîÅ Execution Pipeline

```text
User Input (CLI)
‚Üì
IO Adapter
‚Üì
TextCore.parse(input)
‚Üì
CommandCore.execute(parsed)
‚Üì
Calls Registered Core Command
‚Üì
Response ‚Üí IO.write()
```

Each command is registered using a centralized registry (`register_all_commands.py`).

## üìê OS-Level Abstraction

GPT OS is a **conceptual operating system** for LLMs ‚Äî not a hardware OS, but a **thinking protocol**.
It reframes traditional OS concepts like so:

| OS Component       | GPT OS Equivalent            |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Kernel syscall     | Command dispatch             |
| Shell interpreter  | TextCore                     |
| System services    | Core modules (Memory, Code)  |
| Environment state  | StateManager                 |
| Logging subsystem  | WorkflowLogger               |
| Philosophy Layer   | Meta-cognitive process       |

This abstraction enables simulation of **statefulness**, **self-reflection**, and **persistent logic** in a stateless LLM.

## üß© Extensibility & Plugins

- Modular design allows injection of new commands or core features
- Plugin architecture (planned): auto-register via decorators or folder scan
- REST or GUI interface layers can build on `io_adapter`

---

## üß† Design Philosophy

- **Separation of Logic**: All behavior encapsulated per-core
- **Explicit Locking**: StateManager ensures clarity over runtime modules
- **Philosophical Modularity**: LLMs should reason, not just react
- **Structural Memory**: Simulate thought persistence without database

| Feature             | Status       |

| Core modularity     | ‚úÖ Complete  |
| Help/Command routing| ‚úÖ Complete  |
| Persistence         | ‚è≥ Planned   |
| Tests               | ‚è≥ In progress |

## üß¨ OS Architect's Notes

GPT OS is a living demonstration of how a GPT model can simulate persistent logic, context awareness, and command-line thinking without native memory.

By enforcing modular clarity, it becomes a **programmable thought shell** ‚Äî opening possibilities for LLM-native IDEs, automation assistants, and reflective agents.
