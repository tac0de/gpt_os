# GPT OS üß† ‚Äî A Simulated Operating System for LLMs

> üö® Internal Development Repository (Built in Python)

This project is a conceptual prototype of an operating system designed to interface with large language models (LLMs) like GPT. Unlike traditional chatbot wrappers, GPT OS treats LLMs as programmable, state-aware agents capable of responding to system-level commands and managing internal memory through structured interfaces.

## üìè Project Overview

GPT OS is an experiment in turning an LLM into a structured computation environment. It consists of modular components (‚Äúcores‚Äù) that mirror the responsibilities of a traditional OS: memory management, command parsing, state control, and output handling.

### Core Modules

| Module                           | Description                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Command Core`                   | Parses natural language instructions into structured command objects |
| `Memory Core`                    | Stores, retrieves, and resets persistent memory                      |
| `OS Manager`                     | Central hub for coordinating core behaviors and system routing       |
| *(Planned)* `Text Core`          | Manages output formatting, journaling, and logs                      |
| *(Planned)* `Image Core`         | Placeholder for render simulation                                    |
| *(Planned)* `Philosophical Core` | Handles abstract reasoning and ethical feedback loops                |

## üöÄ Quickstart

### Requirements

* Python 3.10+

```bash
# Clone and run
cd gpt_os
python ui/console.py
```

### Available Commands

```bash
remember key "value"     # Store a value under a key
query key                # Retrieve a value by key
reset                    # Clear all stored memory
log                      # Print current memory state
```

## üß± Architectural Philosophy

GPT OS reimagines LLMs as deterministic agents under system-level control. The OS metaphor enables modular scaling, command chaining, and eventual simulation of multi-agent GPT instances, each with their own context-aware cores.

All functionality is designed to be testable, extensible, and decoupled from actual API inference (simulated calls only).
